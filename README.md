* Bookmarks App *

This is a solo app project created by Emily Compton.

This app let's you bookmark your favorite web pages pages to a condensed view list.
You can choose an expanded view to visit the web page site and read a description.
Feel free to delete a bookmark you do not need anymore while in the expanded view as well.
