* Bookmarks App *

This is a solo app project created by Emily Compton.

This app let's you bookmark your favorite web pages pages to a condensed view list.
You can choose an expanded view to visit the web page site and read a description.
Feel free to delete a bookmark you do not need anymore while in the expanded view as well.

User Stories

As a user:
1. I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:
  -title
  -url link
  -description
  -rating (1-5)

2. I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app
- All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating

3. I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view
  -Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link

4. I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

5. I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
 -Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)

6. I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
